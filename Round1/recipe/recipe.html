        <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>In a large pot over medium heat, add in ground sausage and ground beef. Use a spoon to
                break up the meat into small pieces. Add in onion and garlic and cook until meat is well
                browned, stirring constantly. Stir in sugar, fresh basil, fennel, oregano, 1/2 teaspoon
                salt, pepper, and 1/4 cup chopped parsley. Pour in crushed tomatoes, tomato paste, tomato
                sauce, and wine<a href="#wine"><sup>*</sup></a>. Stir well and bring to a simmer. Reduce heat to low and simmer 1-4 hours,
                stirring occasionally.</li>
            <li>Meanwhile, place lasagna noodles into the bottom of a pan. Pour hot tap water directly over
                the noodles, making sure the pasta is completely immersed in the water. Let them soak for 30
                minutes, then drain and discard water.</li>
            <li>In a mixing bowl, combine ricotta cheese with egg, remaining 2 tablespoons parsley, 1/2
                teaspoon salt, and nutmeg. Refrigerate until ready to assemble lasagna.</li>
            <li>Preheat oven to 375 degrees. Lightly grease a deep 9Ã—13 pan.</li>
            <li>To assemble, spread about 1 cup of meat sauce in the bottom of the prepared pan. Place 4 noodles
                on top. Spread with 1/3 of the ricotta cheese mixture. Top with 1/4 of mozzarella cheese slices.
                Spoon 1 1/2 cups meat sauce over mozzarella, then sprinkle with 1/4 cup parmesan cheese. Repeat
                layering two more times to create three complete layers. To finish, place a final layer of pasta,
                topped with another 1 cup of meat sauce to cover the pasta. Top with remaining mozzarella and
                Parmesan cheese. Cover loosely with aluminum foil.</li>
            <li>Bake in preheated oven for 25 minutes. Remove foil, and bake an additional 25 minutes to allow
                cheese to brown. Serve hot.</li>
        </ol>
