Ingredients

453.59 g sweet Italian sausage
453.59 g lean ground beef
1 white onion diced
5 cloves garlic minced
1 can crushed tomatoes
2 cans tomato paste
1 can tomato sauce
117.5 g white wine
2 tablespoons white sugar
12 g chopped fresh basil
1 teaspoon fennel seeds
1 teaspoon ground oregano
0.5 teaspoon salt
0.25 teaspoon ground black pepper
15.12 g chopped fresh parsley
453.59 g lasagna noodles
850.49 g ricotta cheese
2 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley
1 egg
0.5 teaspoon salt
0.13 teaspoon ground nutmeg
453.59 g thinly sliced mozzarella cheese about 24 slices
100 g freshly grated Parmesan cheese

Instructions

1. In a large pot over medium heat, add in ground sausage and ground beef. Use a spoon to
   break up the meat into small pieces. Add in onion and garlic and cook until meat is well
   browned, stirring constantly. Stir in sugar, fresh basil, fennel, oregano, 1/2 teaspoon
   salt, pepper, and 1/4 cup chopped parsley. Pour in crushed tomatoes, tomato paste, tomato
   sauce, and wine*. Stir well and bring to a simmer. Reduce heat to low and simmer 1-4 hours,
   stirring occasionally.
2. Meanwhile, place lasagna noodles into the bottom of a pan. Pour hot tap water directly over
   the noodles, making sure the pasta is completely immersed in the water. Let them soak for 30
   minutes, then drain and discard water.
3. In a mixing bowl, combine ricotta cheese with egg, remaining 2 tablespoons parsley, 1/2
   teaspoon salt, and nutmeg. Refrigerate until ready to assemble lasagna.
4. Preheat oven to 375 degrees. Lightly grease a deep 9Ã—13 pan.
5. To assemble, spread about 1 cup of meat sauce in the bottom of the prepared pan. Place 4 noodles
   on top. Spread with 1/3 of the ricotta cheese mixture. Top with 1/4 of mozzarella cheese slices.
   Spoon 1 1/2 cups meat sauce over mozzarella, then sprinkle with 1/4 cup parmesan cheese. Repeat
   layering two more times to create three complete layers. To finish, place a final layer of pasta,
   topped with another 1 cup of meat sauce to cover the pasta. Top with remaining mozzarella and
   Parmesan cheese. Cover loosely with aluminum foil.
6. Bake in preheated oven for 25 minutes. Remove foil, and bake an additional 25 minutes to allow
   cheese to brown. Serve hot.

Notes
*The white wine can be replaced with red wine, chicken broth, or beef broth.
