    <h1>10 Most Common Web Design Mistakes to Avoid in 2019</h1>
    <p>
        The main message of the article is that there exist a handful of mistakes that could 
        be avoided with knowledge of their existence.
    </p>
    <p>
        The first few mistakes that developers make include making the website too slow or 
        heavy through pictures, videos and widgets and then include too little amounts of 
        actual written text to keep the customer involved. These two pretty much go hand in 
        hand. Next up on the list comes negligence toward mobile development after desktop 
        development has been successfully completed. It should be noted that nowadays there 
        are lots of mobile users coming to different websites. To end this paragraph, I will 
        add that headers should be properly utilized as well.

        It should be noted that the websites should include ways to take feedback in and at 
        the same time the websites should be visually pleasing so that visitors like coming 
        to the site along with the interactions that they bring in. Along the lines of the 
        site being pleasant to use the site should not use too much text as the site can be 
        too mentally heavy to read or use. The pleasantry that comes with using the site should 
        also always lead the user to act upon something, i.e. buy something.

        The second last mistake on the list is the negligence toward different keywords that 
        would boost the website higher in different google searches. Lastly, you should always 
        make sure that all links work exactly as intended, or the user will get a vibe that the 
        website is fraudulent.

        Personally, I learned that these mistakes exist, and I think that knowing about these 
        will help me avoid these if I ever find myself working in web development. These 
        mistakes sure sound like they are made easily even if you pay attention to what you 
        are developing.
